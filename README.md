# Urbanization Could (and Should) be Smarter

## The importance of accessibility and technology in smart and sustainable urbanisation

### 15-minute Cities
- We introduced the importance of accessibility and its impact on the quality of life in urban areas to a graduate class at Carnegie Mellon University' School of Architecture, using Cards against Urbanity - a modified version of a popular game. We motivated the
issues that arise out of lack of accessibility and convenient mobility in urban settings. We used 2 cases to explain good and bad practices of accessibility and urbanisation. Attached is the slide deck we used and a reflection from that class.

### Technology in Smart Cities - Implementation and Accountability
- We discussed Quayside in Toronto, Saudi Arabia's Neom and India's Visakhapatnam as case studies on technological solutions for urban problems. We introduced the class to the good, bad and ugly of using technology to 'smarten' a city. We discussed concerns about
accountability, inclusion and local congruence of technology solutions. Attached is the slide deck we used and a reflection from that class.
